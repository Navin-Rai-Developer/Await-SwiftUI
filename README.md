# SwiftUI_AsyncAwait_APIApp

A learning-focused SwiftUI iOS project that demonstrates how to fetch and display data using **Async/Await** with a clean **MVVM architecture**, including image loading and detail screen navigation.

## 🚀 Features

### 📡 API Integration using `Async/Await`
- Calls REST APIs asynchronously using Swift’s modern `async`/`await` syntax.
- Smooth and efficient data fetching without blocking the main thread.

### 🧾 User List with Image
- Fetched data is displayed in a **scrollable list**.
- Each item shows basic user info along with a **remote image**.

### 👤 Detail Screen
- Tap any user from the list to **navigate to the detail view**.
- Detailed view includes full user data (name, email, etc.) and large image.

### 🧠 MVVM Architecture
- Structured code using `Model`, `View`, and `ViewModel`.
- Promotes better **code separation**, **testability**, and **reusability**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
